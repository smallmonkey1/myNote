 134 # By default Redis does not run as a daemon. Use 'yes' if you need it.
 135 # Note that Redis will write a pid file in /var/run/redis.pid when daemonized.
 136 daemonize yes
 137 
 138 # If you run Redis from upstart or systemd, Redis can interact with your
 139 # supervision tree. Options:
 140 #   supervised no      - no supervision interaction
 141 #   supervised upstart - signal upstart by putting Redis into SIGSTOP mode
 142 #   supervised systemd - signal systemd by writing READY=1 to $NOTIFY_SOCKET
 143 #   supervised auto    - detect upstart or systemd method based on
 144 #                        UPSTART_JOB or NOTIFY_SOCKET environment variables
 145 # Note: these supervision methods only signal "process is ready."
 146 #       They do not enable continuous liveness pings back to your supervisor.

 155 #
 156 # Creating a pid file is best effort: if Redis is not able to create it
 157 # nothing bad happens, the server will start and run normally.
 158 pidfile /var/run/redis_6379.pid
 //进程管道ID文件
 159 
 160 # Specify the server verbosity level.
 161 # This can be one of:

### NETWORK

```shell
################################## NETWORK #####################################

# By default, if no "bind" configuration directive is specified, Redis listens
# for connections from all the network interfaces available on the server.
# It is possible to listen to just one or multiple selected interfaces using
# the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.
#
# Examples:
#
# bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1
# bind 127.0.0.1 ::1
#
# ~~~ WARNING ~~~ If the computer running Redis is directly exposed to the
# internet, binding to all the interfaces is dangerous and will expose the
# instance to everybody on the internet. So by default we uncomment the
# following bind directive, that will force Redis to listen only into
# the IPv4 loopback interface address (this means Redis will be able to
# accept connections only from clients running into the same computer it
# is running).
#
# IF YOU ARE SURE YOU WANT YOUR INSTANCE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE INTERFACES
# JUST COMMENT THE FOLLOWING LINE.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
bind 127.0.0.1

# Protected mode is a layer of security protection, in order to avoid that
# Redis instances left open on the internet are accessed and exploited.
#
# When protected mode is on and if:
#
# 1) The server is not binding explicitly to a set of addresses using the
#    "bind" directive.
# 2) No password is configured.
#
# The server only accepts connections from clients connecting from the
# IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and from Unix domain
# sockets.
#
# By default protected mode is enabled. You should disable it only if
# you are sure you want clients from other hosts to connect to Redis
# even if no authentication is configured, nor a specific set of interfaces
# are explicitly listed using the "bind" directive.
protected-mode yes

# Accept connections on the specified port, default is 6379 (IANA #815344).
# If port 0 is specified Redis will not listen on a TCP socket.
port 6379

# TCP listen() backlog.
#
# In high requests-per-second environments you need an high backlog in order
# to avoid slow clients connections issues. Note that the Linux kernel
# will silently truncate it to the value of /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn so
# make sure to raise both the value of somaxconn and tcp_max_syn_backlog
# in order to get the desired effect.
tcp-backlog 511

# Unix socket.
#
# Specify the path for the Unix socket that will be used to listen for
# incoming connections. There is no default, so Redis will not listen
# on a unix socket when not specified.
#
# unixsocket /tmp/redis.sock
# unixsocketperm 700

# Close the connection after a client is idle for N seconds (0 to disable)
timeout 0

# TCP keepalive.
#
# If non-zero, use SO_KEEPALIVE to send TCP ACKs to clients in absence
# of communication. This is useful for two reasons:
#
# 1) Detect dead peers.
# 2) Take the connection alive from the point of view of network
#    equipment in the middle.
#
# On Linux, the specified value (in seconds) is the period used to send ACKs.
# Note that to close the connection the double of the time is needed.
# On other kernels the period depends on the kernel configuration.
#
# A reasonable value for this option is 300 seconds, which is the new
# Redis default starting with Redis 3.2.1.
tcp-keepalive 300
```

**tcp-backlog**：设置tcp的backlog，backlog其实是一个连接队列，`backlog队列总和=未完成3次握手的队列+已经完成3次握手的队列`

在**高并发环境**下需要一个高backlog值来避免慢客户端的连接问题

注意Linux内核会将这个值减小到`/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn`的值，所以需要确认增大somaxconn和tcp_max_syn_backlog两个值来达到想要的效果

**tcp-keepalive**：单位为秒，如果是0，不会进行Keppalive检测，建议60

### SECURITY

```shell
################################## SECURITY ###################################

# Require clients to issue AUTH <PASSWORD> before processing any other
# commands.  This might be useful in environments in which you do not trust
# others with access to the host running redis-server.
#
# This should stay commented out for backward compatibility and because most
# people do not need auth (e.g. they run their own servers).
#
# Warning: since Redis is pretty fast an outside user can try up to
# 150k passwords per second against a good box. This means that you should
# use a very strong password otherwise it will be very easy to break.
#
# requirepass foobared

# Command renaming.
#
# It is possible to change the name of dangerous commands in a shared
# environment. For instance the CONFIG command may be renamed into something
# hard to guess so that it will still be available for internal-use tools
# but not available for general clients.
#
# Example:
#
# rename-command CONFIG b840fc02d524045429941cc15f59e41cb7be6c52
#
# It is also possible to completely kill a command by renaming it into
# an empty string:
#
# rename-command CONFIG ""
#
# Please note that changing the name of commands that are logged into the
# AOF file or transmitted to replicas may cause problems.

```

在redis里面查看密码：

config get requirepass

设置密码：

config set requirpass "123456"

在redis里面输入密码认证：

auth 123456

取消密码：

config set requirpass ""

获取当前启动路径：

config get dir

### NAPSHOTTING快照

```shell
################################ SNAPSHOTTING  ################################
#
# Save the DB on disk:
#
#   save <seconds> <changes>
#
#   Will save the DB if both the given number of seconds and the given
#   number of write operations against the DB occurred.
#
#   In the example below the behaviour will be to save:
#   after 900 sec (15 min) if at least 1 key changed
#   after 300 sec (5 min) if at least 10 keys changed
#   after 60 sec if at least 10000 keys changed
#
#   Note: you can disable saving completely by commenting out all "save" lines.
#
#   It is also possible to remove all the previously configured save
#   points by adding a save directive with a single empty string argument
#   like in the following example:
#
#   save ""

save 900 1
save 120 10
save 60 10000

# By default Redis will stop accepting writes if RDB snapshots are enabled
# (at least one save point) and the latest background save failed.
# This will make the user aware (in a hard way) that data is not persisting
# on disk properly, otherwise chances are that no one will notice and some
# disaster will happen.
#
# If the background saving process will start working again Redis will
# automatically allow writes again.
#
# However if you have setup your proper monitoring of the Redis server
# and persistence, you may want to disable this feature so that Redis will
# continue to work as usual even if there are problems with disk,
# permissions, and so forth.
stop-writes-on-bgsave-error yes

# Compress string objects using LZF when dump .rdb databases?
# For default that's set to 'yes' as it's almost always a win.
# If you want to save some CPU in the saving child set it to 'no' but
# the dataset will likely be bigger if you have compressible values or keys.
rdbcompression yes

# Since version 5 of RDB a CRC64 checksum is placed at the end of the file.
# This makes the format more resistant to corruption but there is a performance
# hit to pay (around 10%) when saving and loading RDB files, so you can disable it
# for maximum performances.
#
# RDB files created with checksum disabled have a checksum of zero that will
# tell the loading code to skip the check.
rdbchecksum yes

# The filename where to dump the DB
dbfilename dump.rdb

# The working directory.
#
# The DB will be written inside this directory, with the filename specified
# above using the 'dbfilename' configuration directive.
#
# The Append Only File will also be created inside this directory.
#
# Note that you must specify a directory here, not a file name.
dir ./
```



`save 900 1`
`save 120 10`
`save 60 10000`

备份策略

**Stop-writes-on-bgsave-error yes**：如果后台保存数据出错，前台要停止写操作，要不然会出现**数据一致性**的问题

**rdbcompression yes**：对于存储到磁盘中的快照，可以设置是否进行压缩存储。如果**yes**，redis会采用LZF算法压缩，如果不想消耗CPU进行压缩，可以关闭

**rdbchecksum yes**：存储快照后，可以让redis用CRC64算法来进行数据校验，但是这样做会增大约10%的**性能损耗**，如果希望获得最大的**性能提升**，可以关闭此功能；；没什么关系，备份一般是在机器空闲才备份，所以那点性能损耗一般无伤大雅

### APPEND ONLY FILE

```shell
############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################

# By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is
# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or
# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on
# the configured save points).
#
# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides
# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy
# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a
# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something
# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is
# still running correctly.
#
# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.
# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file
# with the better durability guarantees.
#
# Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.

appendonly no

# The name of the append only file (default: "appendonly.aof")

appendfilename "appendonly.aof"

# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk
# instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush
# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.
#
# Redis supports three different modes:
#
# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.
# always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.
# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.
#
# The default is "everysec", as that's usually the right compromise between
# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to
# "no" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when
# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of
# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),
# or on the contrary, use "always" that's very slow but a bit safer than
# everysec.
#
# More details please check the following article:
# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html
#
# If unsure, use "everysec".

# appendfsync always
appendfsync everysec
# appendfsync no

# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background
# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is
# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations
# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for
# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block
# our synchronous write(2) call.
#
# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option
# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a
# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.
#
# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is
# the same as "appendfsync none". In practical terms, this means that it is
# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the
# default Linux settings).
#
# If you have latency problems turn this to "yes". Otherwise leave it as
# "no" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.

no-appendfsync-on-rewrite no

# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.
# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling
# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.
#
# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the
# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of
# the AOF at startup is used).
#
# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is
# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also
# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this
# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase
# is reached but it is still pretty small.
#
# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF
# rewrite feature.

auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100
auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb

# An AOF file may be found to be truncated at the end during the Redis
# startup process, when the AOF data gets loaded back into memory.
# This may happen when the system where Redis is running
# crashes, especially when an ext4 filesystem is mounted without the
# data=ordered option (however this can't happen when Redis itself
# crashes or aborts but the operating system still works correctly).
#
# Redis can either exit with an error when this happens, or load as much
# data as possible (the default now) and start if the AOF file is found
# to be truncated at the end. The following option controls this behavior.
#
# If aof-load-truncated is set to yes, a truncated AOF file is loaded and
# the Redis server starts emitting a log to inform the user of the event.
# Otherwise if the option is set to no, the server aborts with an error
# and refuses to start. When the option is set to no, the user requires
# to fix the AOF file using the "redis-check-aof" utility before to restart
# the server.
#
# Note that if the AOF file will be found to be corrupted in the middle
# the server will still exit with an error. This option only applies when
# Redis will try to read more data from the AOF file but not enough bytes
# will be found.
aof-load-truncated yes

# When rewriting the AOF file, Redis is able to use an RDB preamble in the
# AOF file for faster rewrites and recoveries. When this option is turned
# on the rewritten AOF file is composed of two different stanzas:
#
#   [RDB file][AOF tail]
#
# When loading Redis recognizes that the AOF file starts with the "REDIS"
# string and loads the prefixed RDB file, and continues loading the AOF
# tail.
aof-use-rdb-preamble yes

```

**appendonly no**：默认关闭AOF功能

**appendfsync everysec**：选项

* always：同步持久化 每次发生数据变更会被立即记录到磁盘，性能较差但**数据完整性**教好
* everysec：出厂默认 异步操作 每秒记录 如果一秒内宕机  有数据丢失
* no：用no即可，保证数据安全性

**auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100**：设置重写的基准值-100就是1倍
**auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb**：设置重写的基准值

### LIMITS限制

##### MaxClients(default:10000)

##### Maxmemory()

##### Maxmemory-policy(noviction)

* volatile-lru：使用LRU算法移除key，只对设置了过期时间的键
* allkeys-lru：LRU移除所有key
* volatile-lfu：移除使用频率最小的key，设置了过期时间
* allkeys-lfu：移除使用频率最下的key，
* volatile-reandom：在过期集合中随机移除key，只对设置了过期时间的
* allkeys-random：随机移除key
* volatile-ttl：移除TTL值最小的key，即那些最近要过期的key
* noeviction：不移出
* TTL：生命周期

##### Maxmemory-samples(5)

设置样本数量，LRU和最小TTL算法并非是精确的算法，而是估算值，所以需要设置样本的大小，redis默认会检查这么多个key并选择其中LRU的那个或者LFU/TTL那个

### 常见配置reids.conf介绍

**daemonize no**：Redis默认不是以守护进程的方式运行个，可以通过该配置项修改，使用yes后启用守护进程

**pidfile /var/run/redis.pid**：当Redis以守护进程方式运行时，Redis默认会把pid写入`/var/run/redis.pid`文件，可以通过pidfile指定

**bind 127.0.0.1**：绑定主机地址

**timeout 300**：但客户机闲置多长时间后关闭连接，如果为0，表示关闭该功能

**logfile stdout**：日志记录方式，默认为标准输出，如果配置Redis为守护进程方式运行，而这里日志记录方式为标准输出，则日志将会发送给`/div/null`

**dir ./**：指定本地数据库存放目录 

**requirepass foobared**：设置Redis连接密码，默认关闭，客户端链接Redis时候需要通过`AUTH <PASSWORD>`命令提供密码

**maxclients 128**：设置默认客户端连接数，默认无限制，若为0，表示不做限制
